### Branches
Git branches facilitate separate lines of development within a repository,the initial branch(usually called main or master) and then any spun off branches can be pushed to and retain their own version history.
separate branches can then be merged and any conflicts or issues from combining files can be delt with then, reducing time lost developing due to conflicts.
